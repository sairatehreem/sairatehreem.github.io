		<h3><em>  I am not what happened to me, but I am what I chose to be!!!</em><h3> 
<p>I might have my own kind of lousy and lazy ideas to describe me, but i found it better to showcase myself based on what i have  been reflecting so far, which eventually turned out to be my identity,now! </p>
	<p>So, here it goes.. A compilation of my clouts and criticisms.. </p>
			<p>I am basically an <em>ESFP</em>, which actually describes me more, than what is about to follow.But one of my biggest strengths,being an ESFP has been my extroverted nature. I always have had an outstretched hand for a new person into my life!! And,as said, i believe that i possess my own idea of friendship, irrepressible of what others think!..On a simple note, I am open to all kind of personalities, and what has made me all of their favourite is that, i never judge them so easily and i basically care a lot,besides kindling my maternal instinct of self-preservation before i make sacrifices for others! 
My biggest relief from all the chaos happening in the world, has been my love for putting in my thoughts in the form of letters which obviously depicts that i am a kind of person who can never decide to do anything reckless unless i go through a phase of contemplation. </p>
<p>Every now and then i have had bullet holes in my lungs and i am forced to put up with my inner demons, but what baffles myself more is my ability to accept my own flaws and  to learn that i am a crayon in a world of pencils!! And eventually I realised that no matter broken or full, i am still going to colour the world! </p>
